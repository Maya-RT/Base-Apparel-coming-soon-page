## My process

I always start with the mobile design, then proceed to the desktop design. What I found challenging at first was the submit button, I used the position absolute property in CSS and thanks to this challenge I got to understand better how it hast to be used. 
JavaScript part was a little challenging as well since it's my first submit button for an email. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript





### Continued development

I'd realy like to make my next project with a library such as React but I'll see. For now I cannot wait to upgrade my JavaScript skills :D
